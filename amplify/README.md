# Example project for [a first look at amplify with vite](https://dev.to/ajcwebdev/a-first-look-at-amplify-with-vite-1g7j)

[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) is a set of tools and services to help frontend web and mobile developers build scalable fullstack applications with AWS infrastructure.

This tutorial will follow the Getting Started guide for React from the [Amplify documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react), except we will be using Vite and the [officially supported](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) [React template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-app/template-react) instead of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This way the kids will know that I am, "with it."

## Setup

### Configure AWS CLI with `aws configure`

Make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/). For general use, [`aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) is recommended as the fastest way to set up your AWS CLI installation.

```bash
aws configure
```

When you enter this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information:
* Access key ID
* Secret access key
* AWS Region
* Output format

Go to [My Security Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials) to find your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and default region. You can leave the output format blank.

```
AWS Access Key ID: <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS Secret Access Key: <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
Default region name: <YOUR_REGION_NAME>
Default output format [None]: 
```

### Install Amplify CLI

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

## Create React App

```bash
yarn create @vitejs/app ajcwebdev-amplify --template react
```

### Start development server

```bash
cd ajcwebdev-amplify
yarn
yarn dev
```

### package.json

Our `package.json` includes scripts for starting the development server, building for production, and serving local previews of production builds.

```json
{
  "name": "ajcwebdev-amplify",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh": "^1.3.1",
    "vite": "^2.2.3"
  }
}
```

### App component

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import React from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img
          src={logo}
          className="App-logo"
          alt="logo"
        />

        <p>ajcwebdev</p>

        <p>Amplify + Vite</p>

        <p>
          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://dev.to/ajcwebdev"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Blog
          </a>

          {' | '}

          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://github.com/ajcwebdev"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            GitHub
          </a>
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Initialize Amplify project with `amplify init`

To initialize a new Amplify project, run `amplify init` from the root directory of your frontend app.

```bash
amplify init
```

```
? Enter a name for the project: ajcwebdevamplify
? Enter a name for the environment: dev
? Choose your default editor: Visual Studio Code
? Choose the type of app that you're building: javascript

Please tell us about your project
? What javascript framework are you using: react
? Source Directory Path:  src
? Distribution Directory Path: dist
? Build Command: yarn build
? Start Command: yarn dev

Using default provider: awscloudformation

? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use: default
```

## Deploy to hosting with CloudFront and S3 with `amplify publish`

```bash
amplify add hosting
```

```
? Select the plugin module to execute: Amazon CloudFront and S3
? Select the environment setup: DEV (S3 only with HTTP)
? hosting bucket name: ajcwebdevamplify-20210509181751-hostingbucket
? index doc for the website: index.html
? error doc for the website: index.html

You can now publish your app using the following command:
Command: amplify publish
```

```bash
amplify publish
```

```
âœ” Successfully pulled backend environment dev from the cloud.

Current Environment: dev

| Category | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Hosting  | S3AndCloudFront | Create    | awscloudformation |

? Are you sure you want to continue? Yes
```

You will then be taken to the [very memorably named endpoint](http://ajcwebdevamplify-20210509181751-hostingbucket-dev.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/) for your S3 bucket.
