# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `yarn start` - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* `yarn test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* `yarn build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* `yarn eject` - If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
