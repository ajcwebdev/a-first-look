# Example Project from [A First Look at tRPC](https://ajcwebdev.com/2023/03/08/a-first-look-at-trpc/)

[__tRPC__](https://trpc.io/) is a TypeScript library for building end-to-end, type-safe APIs. It creates fully typed endpoints on the backend which can be queried from a frontend written in TypeScript. While it is typically integrated with React or Next, it can be used with [__Vue__](https://github.com/michealroberts/usetrpc), [__Svelte__](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit), or plain TypeScript.
