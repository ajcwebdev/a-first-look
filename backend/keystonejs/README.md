# Example Project from [A First Look at KeystoneJS](https://ajcwebdev.com/2021/08/25/a-first-look-at-keystonejs/)

[KeystoneJS](https://keystonejs.com/) is a CMS for developers that provides a GraphQL API & Management UI for content and data based on your schema. In this tutorial we will use `create-keystone-app` to scaffold a basic blog dashboard with users. In a future part we will deploy this project.

## Clone Repo and Navigate to Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajcwebdev/a-first-look.git
