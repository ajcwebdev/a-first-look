# Example Project from [A First Look at Astro](https://ajcwebdev.com/2021/11/27/a-first-look-at-astro/)

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is an open source web framework influenced by the [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/). It was created by Fred K. Schott, Matthew Phillips, Nate Moore, and Drew Powers as an outgrowth of the work being done simultaneously on Snowpack and Skypack. It supports a variety of UI integrations including React, Svelte, Vue, Solid, and many more. The framework deserves a fair amount of credit for bringing partial hydration and the concept of "Islands of Interactivity" to the mainstream web development conversation.
