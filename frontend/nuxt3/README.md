# Example Project from [A First Look at Nuxt 3](https://ajcwebdev.com/2021/10/15/a-first-look-at-nuxt-3)

Nuxt is a Vue metaframework that aims to make web development intuitive and performant while keeping great developer experience in mind. The original version, created by [SÃ©bastien Chopin in October 2016](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/0072ed31da6ce39d21046e05898f956cff190390), was built to emulate the features of Next.js (such as file-system based routing, server-side rendering, and API routes) but with Vue instead of React. Version 3 has been [over a year in the making](https://nuxtjs.org/announcements/nuxt3-beta/).

## Clone Repo and Navigate to Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajcwebdev/a-first-look.git
cd frontend/nuxt3
```

### Live Examples

* [ajcwebdev-nuxt3.netlify.app](https://ajcwebdev-nuxt3.netlify.app/)
* [ajcwebdev-nuxt3.vercel.app](https://ajcwebdev-nuxt3.vercel.app/)

### Install Dependencies and Start Development Server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash
pnpm i --shamefully-hoist
pnpm dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

### Build for Production

The `nuxi build` command builds your Nuxt application for production. It creates a `.output` directory with your application, server, and dependencies ready to be deployed.

```bash
npm run build
yarn build
pnpm build
```

## App Entry Point

```vue
<!-- app.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtPage />
  </div>
</template>
```

## Pages

The `pages/` directory is optional, meaning that if you only use `app.vue`, `vue-router` won't be included, reducing your application bundle size. However, if you do include it, Nuxt will automatically integrate [Vue Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) and map `pages/` directory into the routes of your application.

### Home Page

```vue
<!-- pages/index.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>ajcwebdev-nuxt3</h2>
  </div>
</template>
```

### About Page

```vue
<!-- pages/about.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>This page tells you stuff about things!</h2>
  </div>
</template>
```

Open [localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about).

### Server Directory for API Routes

The `server/` directory contains API endpoints and server middleware for your project. It is used to create any backend logic for your Nuxt application. Nuxt will automatically read in any files in the `~/server/api` directory to create API endpoints. Each file should export a default function that handles API requests.

```js
// server/api/index.ts

export default () => (`
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta name="description" content="A minimal HTML website served on a Nuxt API route.">
      <title>Nuxt 3 API Route</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
      <header>
        <h2>Hello from Nuxt 3</h2>
      </header>
      <footer>ajcwebdev '22</footer>
    </body>
  </html>
`)
```

Open [localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).

## Deployment

### Netlify

Push your project to a GitHub repository and link it to Netlify. The build commands will be automatically imported from `netlify.toml`.

```toml
# netlify.toml

[build]
  command = "nuxi build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = ".output/server"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/index"
  status = 200
```

### Vercel

```bash
npx vercel
yarn vercel
pnpm vercel
```
