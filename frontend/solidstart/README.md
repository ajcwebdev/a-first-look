It prescribes a recommended way to organize, architect, and deploy SolidJS applications. Vite is included for the build tool along with extra Solid packages for common functionality and a CLI for generating templated projects. These packages enable features such as routing, MetaTags, different rendering modes, TypeScript support, and deployment adapters.
