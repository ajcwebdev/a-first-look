## Setup

```bash
pnpm i # or npm i | yarn
```

## Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev # or npm run dev | yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the running application in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## Build Production App

```bash
pnpm build # or npm run build | yarn build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with an optimized production bundle. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
