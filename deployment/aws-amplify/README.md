# Example Project from [A First Look at Amplify with Vite](https://ajcwebdev.com/2021/05/09/a-first-look-at-amplify-with-vite/)

[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) is a set of tools and services to help frontend web and mobile developers build scalable fullstack applications with AWS infrastructure.

## Clone Repo and Navigate to Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajcwebdev/a-first-look.git
cd deployment/aws-amplify
```

## Setup

### Configure AWS CLI with `aws configure`

Make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/). For general use, [`aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) is recommended as the fastest way to set up your AWS CLI installation.

```bash
aws configure
```

When you enter this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information:
* Access key ID
* Secret access key
* AWS Region
* Output format

Go to [My Security Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials) to find your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and default region. You can leave the output format blank.

```
AWS Access Key ID: <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS Secret Access Key: <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
Default region name: <YOUR_REGION_NAME>
Default output format [None]: 
```

### Install Amplify CLI

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

### Start development server

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Initialize Amplify project with `amplify init`

To initialize a new Amplify project, run `amplify init` from the root directory of your frontend app.

```bash
amplify init
